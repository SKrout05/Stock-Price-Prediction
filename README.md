# Stock Market Price Forecasting Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict future stock prices using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for time series forecasting. 
The model is trained on historical stock data collected from the Tiingo API. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and deployment. 
We use Python and essential libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and pandas. The resulting model provides valuable insights and predictions for stock market trends, 
assisting investors in making informed decisions. Detailed steps and code are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
